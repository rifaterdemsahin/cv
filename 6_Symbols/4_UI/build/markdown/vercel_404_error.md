# Vercel Deployment 404 Error

**URL:** [https://cv-tau-ashen.vercel.app/api/hello](https://cv-tau-ashen.vercel.app/api/hello)

## Error Response

```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: iad1::dlnsb-1759585788955-bb7db689dfb1
```

## Description

The deployed Vercel application is returning a 404 Not Found error for the `/api/hello` endpoint, even though the route is defined in the `index.js` file.

This indicates a potential routing problem within the Vercel serverless environment. Express applications on Vercel sometimes require explicit routing configuration to work correctly.
