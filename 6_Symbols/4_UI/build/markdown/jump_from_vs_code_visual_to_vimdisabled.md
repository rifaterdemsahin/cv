### Seamlessly Transition from Visual Selection to Command Mode in VS Code with Vim Emulation

- V is the magic visual key > instead of using keyboard
- I is the insert mode

For developers accustomed to the modal editing prowess of Vim, replicating that fluid workflow within the feature-rich environment of Visual Studio Code is a key to productivity. A common point of friction when transitioning is understanding how to exit "Visual" mode—the equivalent of making a selection in a traditional editor—and return to "Normal" or command mode. This guide will illuminate the straightforward process of making this jump, alongside customization tips for a more immersive Vim experience in VS Code.

At the heart of Vim's efficiency are its distinct modes. When you select text in VS Code with the Vim extension active, you are typically entering **Visual mode**. This mode is analogous to highlighting text with your mouse. To return to **Normal mode**, where you can execute Vim's powerful commands, the primary key is `Escape` (`<Esc>`).

Here are the standard ways to exit Visual mode and return to Normal mode within the VS Code Vim extension:

  * **Press the `Escape` key (`<Esc>`):** This is the most direct and common method.
  * **Press `v`, `V`, or `Ctrl+v` again:** Depending on how you entered Visual mode (character-wise, line-wise, or block-wise), pressing the same key combination again will toggle you out of it.

**Troubleshooting Inconsistent `Escape` Key Behavior**

Occasionally, the `Escape` key might not behave as expected. This can be due to conflicting keybindings or other extensions. If you encounter this issue, consider the following:

  * **Check for conflicting keybindings:** Open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+K Cmd+S`) and search for any other commands bound to the `Escape` key.
  * **Alternative exit keys:** In your `settings.json` file, you can map other keys to exit Visual mode. For example, to use a double press of the `j` key to escape, you could add a setting like this in your `keybindings.json`:
    ```json
    {
        "key": "j j",
        "command": "extension.vim_escape",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && vim.mode == 'Visual'"
    }
    ```

### Enhancing Your Vim Experience in VS Code

To further bridge the gap between a native Vim environment and VS Code, consider these customization tips for your `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` files:

**1. Navigate Between Editor Splits with Vim Keys:**

Mimic Vim's window navigation by adding these keybindings to your `keybindings.json`:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+h",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusLeftGroup",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && vim.mode != 'Insert'"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+l",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusRightGroup",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && vim.mode != 'Insert'"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+k",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusAboveGroup",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && vim.mode != 'Insert'"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+j",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusBelowGroup",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && vim.mode != 'Insert'"
}
```

**2. Switch Between Tabs Using Vim-like Keys:**

Add these non-recursive keybindings to your `settings.json` to use `Shift+H` and `Shift+L` for tab navigation in Normal mode:

```json
"vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
    {
        "before": ["<S-h>"],
        "commands": ["workbench.action.previousEditor"]
    },
    {
        "before": ["<S-l>"],
        "commands": ["workbench.action.nextEditor"]
    }
]
```

By leveraging the powerful VS Code Vim extension and tailoring your keybindings, you can create a highly efficient and personalized coding environment that combines the best of both worlds. The transition from visual selection back to the command-centric Normal mode will become second nature, streamlining your editing workflow.
