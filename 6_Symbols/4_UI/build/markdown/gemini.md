# 🚀 Project Requirements

Welcome to the CV project! This document outlines everything you need to know to get started.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **⚛️ React Application:** This project features a dynamic React application located in `6_Symbols/4_Html/`. To bring it to life, you'll need:
    *   **🟩 Node.js:** A powerful JavaScript runtime.
    *   **📦 npm** or **🧶 yarn:** Your trusty package managers for Node.js.
    *   **⚛️ React:** The core JavaScript library for building beautiful user interfaces.
    *   **🌐 ReactDOM:** Your gateway to interacting with the DOM in React.

*   **📑 GitHub Pages:** The project is beautifully configured for seamless deployment to GitHub Pages. You can find the magic in the `.github/workflows/static.yml` file.

*   **📜 Bash Scripting:** We love automation! The project uses Bash scripts to effortlessly create files and directories. Explore them in the `6_Symbols/1_Init/` directory.

*   **✍️ Markdown:** The heart of our content! The CVs and all project documentation are crafted with love in Markdown.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is thoughtfully organized into a series of numbered directories, each with a special purpose:

*   **🎯 `1_Real`:** This is where we define our project's **objectives** and **key results**. Think of it as our North Star!
*   **🗺️ `2_Journey`:** Follow our development **journey** and track our progress. It's like a project diary!
*   **🌳 `3_Environment`:** Here you'll find files related to our different output **environments**, such as HTML, LinkedIn, and PDF.
*   **🎨 `4_UI`:** The creative hub! This directory holds the different **versions** of the CV and all the UI components.
*   **🧪 `5_Formula`:** Our secret sauce! This folder contains the **prompts** and **formulas** for generating new CV versions.
*   **🔣 `6_Symbols`:** The engine room! This is where we store all our **data files**, **templates**, and **scripts**.
*   **🤔 `7_Semblance`:** Oops! This is where we document any **errors** or **inconsistencies** we find in the project. It helps us stay on track!
*   **🤔 `8_Testing`:** Testing to come back to the real world
