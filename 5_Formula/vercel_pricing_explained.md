# Formula: Vercel Pricing Explained

This document provides an overview of Vercel's pricing model and answers the question of whether you can pre-load credit for usage.

## Vercel's Pricing Plans

Vercel primarily has two plans relevant for individual developers and small teams:

### 1. Hobby Plan (Free)

This is the plan your projects are currently on. It is designed for personal, non-commercial projects.

*   **Cost:** Free
*   **Features:**
    *   Generous limits on bandwidth, serverless function execution, and builds.
    *   Automatic deployments from your GitHub repository.
    *   Global CDN for fast performance.

For a project like your CV generator and its backend, **the free Hobby plan is more than sufficient.** You are unlikely to hit the usage limits that would require an upgrade.

### 2. Pro Plan (Paid)

This plan is designed for professional developers and teams building commercial applications that require higher usage limits and more features.

*   **Cost:** $20 per user/month (plus usage-based charges for resources beyond what's included in the plan).
*   **Billing Model:** This is a **monthly subscription**. It is not a pay-as-you-go or pre-paid credit system.

## Can I load Â£10 of credit and use it for a year?

**No, this is not how Vercel's billing works.**

You cannot pre-load a small amount of credit to be used over a long period. If you need to move to a paid plan, you would subscribe to the Pro plan for a recurring fee of $20 per month.

Any usage beyond the Pro plan's included amounts would be billed as extra charges on top of your monthly subscription fee.

## Recommendation for Your Project

**Stay on the free Hobby plan.** It provides everything you need for your current projects without any cost. You do not need to add any payment information or worry about incurring charges. You should only consider upgrading to the Pro plan if your project becomes a commercial product with very high traffic.
