# Download Buttons Not Appearing After Successful CV Generation

## Symptom

Even though the debug log shows that the CV generation process completes successfully, the generated CV content and the new download buttons (PDF, Markdown) do not appear on the page.

## Debug Log Analysis

```
[18:21:06] Sending data to backend service...
[18:21:35] Received response from backend.
[18:21:35] CV generation complete.
```

The log indicates that the `fetch` request to the n8n webhook was successful and that the entire `try` block in the `generateCv` function completed without throwing an error. The code then proceeds to the `finally` block.

## Final Diagnosis and Resolution

The debug logs confirmed that the n8n workflow was returning a JSON object with a different structure than the application expected. 

*   **Expected Structure:** `{"html": "...", "markdown": "..."}`
*   **Actual Structure:** `{"message": "...", "output": "..."}`

Because the application was looking for an `html` property that didn't exist, the component would never render the generated content or the download buttons.

### The Fix:

The `App.js` component was refactored to handle the actual data structure being returned:

1.  **Parse Correct Field:** The code was updated to read the markdown string from the `output` field of the JSON response.
2.  **Remove `cvHtml` State:** The state variable for holding HTML (`cvHtml`) was removed, and the `cvMarkdown` state is now the single source of truth for the generated content.
3.  **Render with `ReactMarkdown`:** The component now uses the `<ReactMarkdown>` component directly to render the `cvMarkdown` state. This is more secure than using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and correctly displays the formatted CV.
4.  **Buttons Visibility:** Since the download buttons' visibility is dependent on the content state (`cvMarkdown`), this change also fixes the issue of the buttons not appearing.

This solution makes the application more robust by correctly handling the data it receives from the backend and using a safer method for rendering the content.
