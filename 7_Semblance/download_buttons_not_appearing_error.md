# Download Buttons Not Appearing After Successful CV Generation

## Symptom

Even though the debug log shows that the CV generation process completes successfully, the generated CV content and the new download buttons (PDF, Markdown) do not appear on the page.

## Debug Log Analysis

```
[18:21:06] Sending data to backend service...
[18:21:35] Received response from backend.
[18:21:35] CV generation complete.
```

The log indicates that the `fetch` request to the n8n webhook was successful and that the entire `try` block in the `generateCv` function completed without throwing an error. The code then proceeds to the `finally` block.

## Diagnosis

The visibility of the CV content and the download buttons is controlled by the `cvHtml` state variable. The buttons only render if `cvHtml` has a truthy value.

```javascript
{cvHtml && (
    <div className="cv-container">...</div>
)}
```

The issue is almost certainly in how the response from the n8n webhook is being handled:

```javascript
const result = await response.json();
setCvHtml(result.html);
setCvMarkdown(result.markdown);
```

If the buttons are not appearing, it means `cvHtml` is not being set to a valid string. This can happen if:

1.  The response from the webhook is not valid JSON, causing `response.json()` to fail silently or in a way not caught as expected.
2.  The response is valid JSON, but it does not contain an `html` property. In this case, `result.html` would be `undefined`, and `cvHtml` would be set to `undefined` (a falsy value).

Given that the user previously confirmed they could update the n8n workflow, the most likely scenario is that the workflow is not yet returning the data in the expected `{"html": "...", "markdown": "..."}` format.

## Debugging Step

To confirm this, the next step is to add more detailed logging to `App.js` to inspect the exact response body being returned by the n8n webhook.
