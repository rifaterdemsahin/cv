files in /Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/cv/6_Symbols/2_Data. My plan is to modify the React app to fetch these files, then send their content and a user-provided job description to an n8n endpoint for processing. The app will then display the returned HTML CV. I'll start by creating a new, improved index.html and style.css in /Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/cv/6_Symbols/4_UI/, then rewrite App.js to handle the fetching and posting logic. I'll assume the n8n endpoint is https://n8n.rifaterdemsahin.com/webhook/cv.

I have updated the App.js file with the new logic for dynamic CV generation. I also created the index.html and style.css files.

Now, when you run the React application in the 6_Symbols/4_UI directory, you will see a text area to input a job description and a "Generate CV" button. When you click the button, it will fetch the markdown files from 6_Symbols/2_Data, send them to your n8n workflow along with the job prompt, and display the generated CV on the page.

Please make sure you have a local server running to serve the files, as the fetch API requires it. If you still see the error "Could not fetch CV data", please check the browser's developer console for more details about the network requests.

### Problem Analysis and Solution

**Problem:** The error "Could not fetch CV data" was caused by a fundamental web security restriction. A JavaScript application running in a browser (like your React app) is not allowed to directly access the local file system using `fetch()` with paths like `../2_Data/`. The React development server serves files from its root directory (`6_Symbols/4_UI/`), and for security reasons, it cannot access parent directories.

**Solution:**

1.  **Make Data Accessible:** I created a `public` directory inside your React app's folder (`6_Symbols/4_UI/public`). This is the standard folder for serving static assets like images, data files, and the main `index.html`.
2.  **Copy Data Files:** I copied all the markdown files from `6_Symbols/2_Data/` into a new `6_Symbols/4_UI/public/data/` directory. Files inside the `public` folder are served directly by the development server.
3.  **Update Fetch Logic:** I modified `App.js` to change the `fetch` path from the invalid `../2_Data/${file}` to the correct, publicly accessible `/data/${file}`.
4.  **Correct HTML Script Path:** I updated `6_Symbols/4_UI/index.html` to load the main React script from the correct path (`/static/js/bundle.js`) which is the standard for Create React App builds, ensuring the application loads correctly.

The application should now function as intended, successfully fetching the data files and generating the CV.
